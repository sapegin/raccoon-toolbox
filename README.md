## Motivation

There are many similar apps already, such as [DevUtils](https://devutils.com/) or [DevToys](https://devtoys.app/) but they are often expensive, have poor UX, or don’t have the tools I need. Also, I wanted to have a tool that I can use as a Mac app and a web app.

## Development

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
npm run dev:app
```

## Building

```bash
npm run build
npm run build:app
```
